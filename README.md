# libft

This is a C library. The mandatory part includes string manipulation, memory management and file descriptor writting. The bonus is a module for manipulating linked lists.

The "project" folder contains the files at the time of evaluation. The "libft" folder is an updated version that contains other projects as a part of the library, and might contain any other useful function.  

To fully understand the scope of this project, I invite you to read the subject.
